            Heart Disease Prediction System is a user-friendly web-based application 
            which predicts heart disease using Machine Learning Algorithm. 
            The data extracted from patient includes different 13 parameters like blood pressure, age, sex etc.
            The result is extracted by processing patientâ€™s dataset and a data of patients to whom we need to predict the chance 
            of occurrence of a heart disease.

              Anyone with a device having browser and internet can easily use Heart Disease Prediction System. If you want to predict heart 
              disease using HDPS, all you need is to enter accurate value of 13 different attributes that system asks like age, sex, 
              blood pressure and so on. HDPS will then return the chances of having heart disease in probability which resides from 0-1. 
              In addition to that, if you want to save data for future purpose and want guidance on what to do next, you can simply sign
               up to the system which provides all those features.
